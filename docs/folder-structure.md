### api
Where API calls and settings are held / implementation of ajax/api calls and error handlings such as 404, 500

### common (utils)
All common functions, constants and configs goes here, you can also call it `utils`

### components
Where you can keep your dumb/presentational components
[Dan Abramov what's dumb/presentational component] (https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)

#### hoc
Higher Order Components goes here

### i18n
Where you keep your Internationalization and localization files/logics

### models
Where you keep Rematch models

### pages
Where you keep your pages and specific files for the each page, these are also includes container/smart components. Mostly these components are connected to redux using `connect` or there are totally unique in the whole app and used only once.

### router
Where you keep routing setup files. This is __ONLY__ valid for Create React App as Next.js has its own routing. 

### views
This is same as pages but __ONLY__ for Next.js projects as Next.js as it's own paging and routing system it's better to create a file file and  do logic under `views` folder then import it to `pages` folder.

# do's / don'ts

### do
- create folder for each component and pages/views
- give a `PascalCase` name to your component folder
- create an index.js file and do your component implementation
- create a `styled.js` file andcreate your styled components there

#### don't
- if you have styles dont create styled components in `index.js` (root file of component folder)
- dont create file like `Footer/Footer.js` instead do `Footer/index.js`
- dont create common or shared file at same level with package.json except development files(eslint, stylint, gitignore, nextjs-config), either put them in a folder or create them under `src` folder
